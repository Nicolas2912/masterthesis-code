Q045,"What is the procedure for calibrating the hot wire current output, and what range of current can be achieved with a 10 VDC input signal?",UNANSWERABLE,False,False,"To calibrate the hot wire current output in the MFS-V3 system, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Job File Editor Settings:**
   - Use the Abicor Binzel MFS Service Software to access the Job Data Editor. This interface allows you to configure various parameters for the job, including the hot wire current.

2. **Set the Maximum Hot Wire Current:**
   - In the Job Data Editor, locate the field labeled ""Max. hot wire current."" This setting determines the maximum current that the power source will output for the hot wire.
   - Enter the desired maximum current value in Amperes (A). The system will use this value to scale the analog input signal.

3. **Input Signal Range:**
   - The power source receives an analog target value ranging from 0 to 10 VDC. This input signal is used to control the hot wire current.
   - The relationship between the input voltage and the hot wire current is linear. Therefore, 0 VDC corresponds to 0 A, and 10 VDC corresponds to the maximum current set in the ""Max. hot wire current"" field.

4. **Calibration:**
   - To calibrate, ensure that the input signal accurately reflects the desired current output. For example, if the maximum hot wire current is set to 100 A, then an input of 10 VDC should result in a 100 A output.
   - Adjust the input signal as needed to verify that the output current matches the expected values across the entire range (0 to 10 VDC).

5. **Save and Apply Settings:**
   - After configuring the maximum hot wire current and verifying the input-output relationship, save the settings in the Job Data Editor.
   - Click the ""Apply"" button to ensure that all changes are implemented.

**Range of Current Achievable:**
- With a 10 VDC input signal, the system can achieve the maximum hot wire current set in the ""Max. hot wire current"" field. For example, if set to 100 A, a 10 VDC input will result in a 100 A output.

This procedure ensures that the hot wire current output is accurately calibrated according to the specified maximum current setting.
