- **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where continuous monitoring and adjustment are necessary, such as in environments with variable conditions.

#### 2. Job Selection

- **Description**: This mode allows for the use of preconfigured jobs that are loaded via a bit pattern through the bus interface. These jobs are created and saved using the service software.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for repetitive tasks where the same parameters are used consistently, allowing for quick setup and execution.

### Configuring and Saving Preconfigured Jobs

To configure and save preconfigured jobs, follow these steps using the 'Job file editor settings':

#### Job File Editor Settings (MFS-V3 only)

1. **Access the Job File Editor**:
   - Use the service software version 6.0 or above to access the job file editor.

2. **Set Parameters**:
   - **Max. Hot Wire Current [A]**: Set the maximum hot wire current for the power source. This is done by entering an analog target value (0…10 VDC) that corresponds to the desired current range (0... max. A).
   - **Hot Wire Current**: Enter the target value for the hot wire current in amperes. If the current is to be specified via a bus, select the ‘Hot Wire from Bus’ field.
   - **Wire Speed**: Enter the target value for the wire speed in meters per minute. If the speed is to be specified via a bus, select the ‘Wire Speed from Bus’ field.
   - **Tolerance**: Specify the tolerance of two wire windows in percent.
   - **Positioning**: Set the backwards and forwards positioning values.
   - **Delay**: Define the delay between backwards and forwards positioning.
   - **Motor Current Limits**: Set motor current limits for pre-warning and errors for both drives.
   - **Job Number and Description**: Assign a job number and provide a description for the job.

3. **Save the Job**:
   - Once all parameters are set, save the job configuration within the job file editor.

4. **Transfer to eBOX**:
   - Use the 'Import Job' button to transfer the saved job to the eBOX. It is recommended to save the job to the memory location corresponding to the job number.

5. **Export and Manage Jobs**:
   - Use the 'Export Job' button to save a selected job externally.
   - Use the 'Exp. All Jobs' button to save all jobs externally.
   - Use the 'Delete Job' button to remove a specific job from the eBOX.
   - Use the 'Delete All Jobs' button to clear all jobs from the eBOX.
   - Use the 'Edit Job' button to modify and re-save a selected job.

Q038,"Explain how to use the 'Monitoring mode' to visualize process data, monitor warnings and errors, and access historical log files, referencing both the 'Channel visualisation monitoring settings' and the 'Log file path monitoring settings'.",MULTI_CHAPTER,True,False,"To effectively use the 'Monitoring mode' for visualizing process data, monitoring warnings and errors, and accessing historical log files, you need to understand and configure both the 'Channel visualisation monitoring settings' and the 'Log file path monitoring settings'. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Channel Visualisation Monitoring Settings

1. **Accessing Channel Visualisation:**
   - In user level 1 mode, you can only read pre-configured setup files by selecting ‘Load Setup File’. This mode does not allow modifications or creation of new setup files.
   - In user level 2 mode, you can create and modify setup files. Ensure you save all entries/changes to prevent data loss.

2. **Configuring Channels:**
   - Specify the number of channels to be displayed in the Monitoring window.
   - Set parameters for each channel, such as Drive, Gear Reduction, Encoder, and Meas. Wheel, to define the master drive settings.
   - Use the 'Start/Stop Trigger' to determine the signal that initiates or halts the recording of log files.

3. **Visualizing Data:**
   - The Monitoring window is divided into sections (Top left, Centre left, Bottom left, Middle) to display different types of data.
   - Ensure the correct setup files are loaded to visualize the desired channels and their settings.

### Log File Path Monitoring Settings

1. **Setting Log File Path:**
   - In user level 2 mode, configure the path for saving log files by selecting a folder path previously created in Windows.
   - Click ‘Select this path for log files’ to set the desired path for storing log files.

2. **Configuring Data Format:**
   - Choose the data format for the CSV file to be created. The 'Ring Memory' option allows older log data to be deleted after a specified number of days.
   - Enable the 'Data Separator' to ensure proper formatting of the CSV file.

3. **Managing Log Files:**
   - Specify the number of days until files will be deleted to manage storage space effectively.
   - Use the 'Apply' button to save all settings.

### Monitoring Mode Operations

1. **Visualizing Process Data:**
   - Use the 'Channel visualisation monitoring settings' to display real-time data for the configured channels.
   - Monitor the process data in the designated sections of the Monitoring window.

2. **Monitoring Warnings and Errors:**
   - The Monitoring mode includes a history list of warnings and errors stored successively.
   - View warnings and errors more closely or remove them from the list by right-clicking.
   - All messages are permanently stored in an ‘ErrorLog.txt’ file at the specified log path.

3. **Accessing Historical Log Files:**
   - Use the 'Log file path monitoring settings' to access and manage historical log files.
   - Ensure the log file path is correctly set and that the data format is configured to facilitate easy access and analysis of historical data.

### Additional Considerations

- **Connection Requirements:**
  - Ensure an active connection to the eBOX for settings adjustments and real-time monitoring.
  - For Ethernet communication, a subfolder with the corresponding IP address is automatically generated in the path defined above.

Q043,"What is the range of values that can be set for the wire feed-in rate and acceleration time within the eBOX settings, and how do these settings affect the performance of the wire feeding process?",NUMERICAL,True,False,"The range of values that can be set for the wire feed-in rate and acceleration time within the eBOX settings are as follows:

- **Wire Feed-in Rate:** This can be set to between 0.1 and 10 meters per minute (m/min).
- **Acceleration Time of the Wire Feed-in Rate:** This can be set to between 0.5 and 5 seconds.

### Impact on Wire Feeding Process Performance:

1. **Wire Feed-in Rate:**
   - **Lower Rates (0.1 m/min):** Suitable for applications requiring precise control and minimal wire feed, such as delicate or small-scale welding tasks. Lower rates can help in reducing wire wastage and improving accuracy in applications where the wire needs to be fed slowly.
   - **Higher Rates (up to 10 m/min):** Beneficial for high-speed welding operations where a larger amount of wire needs to be fed quickly. This can increase productivity and is suitable for larger or thicker materials that require more filler material.

2. **Acceleration Time:**
   - **Shorter Acceleration Times (0.5 seconds):** Allows the wire to reach the desired feed-in rate more quickly, which can be advantageous in processes where rapid changes in wire feed are necessary. This can help in reducing the time taken to stabilize the wire feed, thus improving overall process efficiency.
   - **Longer Acceleration Times (up to 5 seconds):** Provides a more gradual increase in wire feed rate, which can be useful in applications where a smooth transition is needed to prevent wire breakage or to ensure consistent weld quality. This can be particularly important in processes where the material or joint configuration is sensitive to sudden changes in wire feed.

By adjusting these settings, operators can optimize the wire feeding process to match the specific requirements of the welding or brazing task, ensuring both efficiency and quality in the final output.","## Wire Feed-In Rate and Acceleration Time Range
