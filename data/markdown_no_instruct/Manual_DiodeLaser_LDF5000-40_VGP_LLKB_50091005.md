# 2.5 Laser-specific Safety Instructions

Warning – Danger from Laser Radiation!

The laser beam can lead to irreparable personal injury.

- When working with the diode laser, strictly observe protection measures, as laid down by the Prevention of Accidents Ordinance, BGV B2 and EN 60825, Part 1, as well as additional norms and regulations.
- Please observe all attached safety labels for your own personal health and safety.

The following information is to be strictly observed when operating the diode laser:

- The diode laser operates in invisible wavelengths within a range of approx. 800 to 980 nm and is rated in laser class 4. Laser class 4 designates a high beam power and any of its diffuse reflection can be dangerous. Skin and eyes are not to be exposed to this radiation. The radiation of the beam power can lead to irreparable personal injury and damage to health. When working with the diode laser, all protective measures are to be followed in accordance with Prevention of Accidents Ordinance BGV B2 and EN 60825, Part 1, as well as all other norms and regulations.
- The operation of the laser facilities rated as class 4 must be registered with the Employers’ Liability Association and the authorities responsible for work protection.
- In order to operate the diode laser, a trained authorized representative for laser protective procedures must be appointed in written form.
- Operate the system or unit only when all protective facilities and safety-related devices, e.g., exhaust system, EMERGENCY OFF switch and safety circuit are connected and in working order.

# Manual LDF 5000-40

- The diode laser may only be operated in a system which is correspondingly rated as laser class 1. In the event of non-observance of this stipulation, the manufacturer shall not assume any liability for any resulting damage.
- The operating instructions should always be kept near the location where the diode laser is being operated. In addition to the operating instructions, all current statutory laws and other regulations for accident protection and those concerning environmental protection are to be observed. All persons working with the system or unit are to be thoroughly trained and qualified.
- Never look directly into the laser beam!
- All persons who work on and with this system or unit are required to carefully read the operating instructions and, in particular, the chapter containing the safety instructions. This also applies to those persons who only occasionally work on the system, e.g., during maintenance work, etc.
- There should be access restrictions for those people who do not work on or with the laser, e.g. using a key-operated switch.
- Settings and maintenance work are only to be carried out by the manufacturer’s technical team; otherwise there is a danger of damage to the diode laser or unintentional exposure to laser radiation.

# 2.6 Information concerning special types of danger

The high-powered diode laser generates a very intensive beam which can be emitted from a primary and secondary potential of danger areas. The laser beam, as a primary danger source can lead to irreparable injuries to the eyes and skin. Secondary potential dangers are not directly laser-specific and can be in the form of poisoning and destruction resulting from explosion and fire.

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 2.6.1 Primary Danger

The primary danger is the result of the essential difference between conventional light sources and a light source emitted by a laser; i.e., in the so-called bundling of the laser light: A conventional light source, e.g., a normal light bulb radiates its light throughout an entire room. In contrast, the diode laser light is bundled to a small focused line spot. If the eye is exposed, the laser beam is focused through the lens of the eye onto the retina. The focused spot of the laser beam on the retina amounts to only a few micrometers, while the light of a normal light bulb is spread over a larger area on the retina (approx. 0.1 mm). The light concentration (power density), in the case of a laser beam, is greater by a factor of a million than that of a light bulb. The laser beam can, in the event of unintentional exposure to the eye, cause serious damage to this organ. The invisible laser beam of the diode laser (approx. 800 to 980 nm) penetrates the optical membranes of the eye (corneal, hydatoid, lens and vitreum) on down to the retina causing serious damage to this part of the eye.

Observance must also be paid to dangers resulting from reflection. Reflections, e.g. the beam randomly hitting a workpiece as well as any other reflecting surfaces, can also lead to serious eye injuries. Importantly, in this context, is those materials which appear visually ‘rough’ to the human eye, are, in actuality, not so rough, and the long wavelength of infrared light can be reflected. As long as the surface roughness is smaller than the wavelength of the beam being used, this can result in a good reflector.

The danger to the skin by direct exposure of the beam is rated as considerably less than that to the eye. Since the skin is also an optically transparent medium, penetration depth and emission of laser radiation when working with the laser must be strictly observed. The maximum penetration depth lies at approx. 760 nm for these wavelengths, damage to the hypodermis can also occur.

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 2.6.2 Secondary Danger:

Not only the direct exposure to laser radiation can result in injuries, but also indirect effects can endanger personnel and the environment.

When using high-power lasers there is always a latent danger of fire and explosion, in particular, when there are flammable or in any other way reactive materials positioned in the area. Therefore, make sure that no flammable or explosion-prone substances are in the vicinity of the location where the laser is being used.

Even the formation of gas and smoke can additionally impair personal health. In particular, the vaporization of plastics can create extraordinarily dangerous substances.

# 3 BASIC STRUCTURE OF A DIODE LASER

Essentially, the diode laser head consists of a stack of individual diode laser components with lenses for shaping and projecting the beam.

The following schematic illustration shows a diode laser head:

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 3.1 Structure of a Diode Laser Component

A diode laser bar consists of many individual emitters with a size of 0.5 x 3 μm² which are arranged in a row and mounted on a cooling element. The output of such a diode laser amounts to 30 watt and more. These components are stacked one upon the other. This structure allows an increase in laser intensity to more than 100 watt.

# Energy supply to the diode laser components

The diode laser components are supplied with electrical power and coolant water. The DC voltage excites the semiconductor material that makes up the diode laser bar and causes it to laser. The DC current is generated by a mains power pack which is adapted to the requirements of the diode laser.

# Cooling the diode laser stack

Converting the electrical output in the laser bar to optical output produces up to 70 % waste heat which is dissipated to a cooling element. In order to avoid heat accumulation, water is pumped through the cooling element. Via an external heat exchanger the heat generated by the diode laser stack is dissipated into ambient air.

# Focusing the laser beam

For focusing the emitted diode laser beam, at first the beam is collimated with a microbar lens near the diode laser component in Fast-Axis (vertical to the emitter level). In further beam projection the divergence in Slow-Axis direction (parallel to the emitter level) is collimated by a cylindrical lens. The bundling and projection of this two-fold collimated laser beam onto a minute area of a work piece is finalized by the laser’s focusing optics.

# Special characteristics of a diode laser system

In contrast to other laser sources (laser heads) for which a single beam with high intensity is generated in the laser-active medium, high-performance diode laser systems are based on the combination of many individually focused beams. The actual beam sources are ti-

# Manual LDF 5000-40

ny semiconductor diodes that are arranged so-called bar. The great disadvantage of this is the extreme angle of divergence with which the beam is emitted. In a vertical direction to the emitter row (Fast-Axis) it amounts up (Slow-Axis) is approximately 10° (round angle). Depending on the focusing optics used, the respective distance to the work piece is determined.

in a row forming a to 90°, parallel to it

# Polarization and wavelength coupling

In order to double the emitted laser performance, two different laser wavelengths are combined using a suitable dielectric mirror. This principle is known as wavelength coupling. Furthermore, the excellent polarization of the laser beam can be used for a further increase in output performance. In addition to wavelength coupling, two beam fields that are polarized linearly can be combined by means of suitable mirrors. By using both procedures, the output intensity of the laser system can be increased by about a factor of four while maintaining an almost constant beam quality.

# FIBER- COUPLED DIODE LASER : LDF

The laser beam is transmitted via a laser light cable directly to the work pieces being machined. As a result, the original focus of the diode laser beam can be transferred as a round, fine, focused spot. The laser light cables are equipped with temperature and rupture monitoring sensors; and are able to be replaced by simply plugging in without re-adjustment. The monitoring cable registers any failure to the control panel, which, in the case of any malfunction, immediately shuts down the laser system.

The following describes the essential functional units:

- The supply unit supplies the laser with all necessary operational functions and monitors the integrated diode laser head in which the diode laser stacks, laser beam focusing elements and sensors are integrated.
- The laser light cables are available in various core dimensions, (measured in μm, e. g., 400; 600, 1000, 1500 μm) for the varying laser power classes.
- Various additional components such as e.g., pyrometer, scanner, shutter or CCD camera, which are adapted to the respective application, can also be retro-fitted upon special needs and on request.

# 7.3.2 External cooling water circuit

The external cooling circuit is led to a plate heat exchanger, where the waste heat of the internal cooling circuit is dissipated. A solenoid (magnetic valve) regulates the amount of water flowing to the external circuit and the heat exchanger. Connection of the external cooling circuit is carried out in the connection area of the supply unit.

# Characteristics

|Temperature inlet|+ 10°C .. +16°C (systems ≥ 6000W)|+10°C .. 14°C|
|---|---|---|
|Pressure|0.5 bar (Min.) to 6 bar (Max.)| |
|Pressure difference|≥ 0.5 to ≤ 2.5 bar (magnetic valve open)| |
|pH value|6..9| |
|Connectors|feed and return lines|Plastic hose nozzle 19mm Ø|
|Materials|Stainless steel, brass, plastics| |

# Requirements for the cooling circuit:

- When the solenoid (magnetic valve) is closed, dynamic pressure builds up. The external cooling circuit must therefore, be able to withstand such pressure; and it may not exceed an increase in pressure of > 6 Bar.
- Make sure that a minimal radius of bend of approx. 250 mm is ensured for the cooling unit hoses.
- The external cooler should be equipped with an overflow valve in order to protect against malfunction (icing).

Laserline GmbH, Germany

Version: 01_01_00

Page 7-5
---
# Manual LDF 5000-40

The external coolant circuit is not equipped with a water filter. If extremely dirty coolant water is used with dirt particles greater than 0.5 mm, this can lead to the malfunctioning of the magnetic valve. In the event of this, the temperature of the coolant water will fall drastically. If considerably dirty water is being used in the coolant system, the user is obliged to install a suitable water filter in the external coolant circulation system.

# Note – Cooling Circuit

- Should the external feed and return lines be mixed up, the temperature of the coolant declines sharply.
- A polluted magnetic valve also leads to a low coolant temperature.
- Before connecting the system to the external coolant system, a complete flushing (rinsing) of the coolant lines is to be carried out.

# Note – Cooling circuit

- If the external cooling circuit is operated with a low water pressure, the solenoid remains open for a longer period of time.
- In the case of a higher water pressure, the solenoid is open for only a short time.

# 7.3.3 Internal cooling circuit

The internal cooling water circuit absorbs the waste heat of the laser as well as the switch mode power supply and leads it to the external cooling circuit of the plate heat exchanger. The cooling circuit is equipped with two water filters that ensure clean coolant water to the laser and the switch mode power supply. Sensors are provided for water temperature, coolant level in the water tank, coolant volume flow as well as DI-value; these sensors continuously transmit the actual real-time data to the control system. A DI-cartridge continuously de-mineralizes the coolant water.

# 7.3.4 Filling the cooling system

Follow the procedure below for filling the cooling system:

- First remove (open) the rear panel (door) of the supply unit and unscrew the cap on the filling neck.
- Fill the cooling water reservoir with the coolant until the water level reaches the max. mark on the water level gauge.

Now put the VG, as described in the following chapters, into operation. The cooling system must now operate for a few minutes to enable the coolant to begin to flow through the system. The coolant level will drop after a short time.

- Refill the water reservoir until the max. level is reached again.
- Check the coolant water level at least once or twice a month; if necessary add coolant water.

# Note - Coolant

- Please pay attention to cooling water requirements in particular concerning DI value and pH-value.
- During normal usage of the laser, water should only be filled up whenever required. A complete change should only be performed for first installation and for shipment.

# 8.13 Using LL-Control

# 8.14 Control modes of the laser system

The diode laser system can basically be operated in two different control modes.

- The first mode is the so-called LOCAL mode. If the system is in the LOCAL mode, the test will take place via the operating field of the system.
- The second operating mode is the so-called EXTERNAL mode. If the system is switched in the EXTERNAL mode, the control test will take place with the client interface. Functions like Laser ready, Laser ON/OFF, Pilot laser ON/OFF can be switched only via the client interface.

The switch-over between LOCAL and EXTERNAL control modes takes place in the menu “Configuration /General page 8-50”.

Note: The switch-over between LOCAL and EXTERNAL modes does not affect the external power preset via a 0-10 V signal. An operation mode is concerned in case of the power preset.

Laserline GmbH, Germany Version: ll-control 1.8 Page 8-63
---
# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 8.14.1 Extended control mode field bus

The laser system can be provided with a field bus interface as control option. Basic functions of the system like Laser ready, Laser ON/OFF, Pilot laser ON/OFF similar to the X3 interface can be controlled via this bus interface. Additionally the bus interface offers extended functions for the selection of laser programs as well as for the control of a beam switch, reaction to external errors etc.

If the field bus is activated in the console, the control functions of the client interface (X3) become inactive. An external control is possible only via the bus interface. The LOCAL/EXTERNAL selector switch in the operation unit becomes also inactive. A switch-over between LOCAL and EXTERNAL mode can take place with active field bus only via the bus interface (cf. chapter 9 “Field bus interface”).

# info – Fieldbus

- The possibility for the power preset via a 0-10V signal via the client interface remains valid. Moreover the additional functions of the programming mode on the interface can be completely used.
- The mode “LOCAL” continues to refer to the operation unit also when the bus is active.

# 8.15.3 Pulsed Operation (SP)

In pulsed mode a certain number of pulses can be generated. The time of the pulse (T_puls) and the pause time (T_pause) can be preset. However, the values for T_puls and T_pause may not be set below 10ms. The pulse repetition rate is set by the factor N. After the diode laser has executed the N-Pulse, it automatically shuts off.

# Info - Pulse time

- The maximum length of one pulse is 60000ms.
- The minimum length of one pulse is 10ms.

# 8.16 Program mode (PRG)

In this mode, the laser system can be controlled via sequence programs. The user creates and saves a program which can then be executed by the laser control unit. Various freely selectable commands exist in the program mode for this purpose. These enable the setting of the laser power, opening and closing of the shutter, program loops, power ramps as well as reacting to external occurrences. Additionally, commands are available for the field bus interface (only usable if the fieldbus interface is available).

# 8.16.1 General Information

Basically a command contains the instruction itself as well as the related parameters. Most of the instructions have two parameters. For commands with less than two or no parameters it is possible to enter values. However these are not respected. If a program is ended, the shutter will be closed automatically. A defined time is necessary from the time of the command to the complete opening/closing of the shutter. This time value depends on the model of the shutter. For more information, refer to "System Options/Shutter". In combination with a beam switch a suitable beam path can be selected for each program and be assigned to individual programs. Several beam combinations can be realized by different programs. The beam path is entered and saved together with the corresponding program.

# 8.16.5 Explanation of the commands

Info

The entries in square brackets [ ] correspond to the parameters of a command. If a command has only 1 parameter or none at all, this symbol [--] is used.

# 1 SET [Time] [Output Power]

This Set Command is used for setting the laser output power. It sets the laser power to a certain value for a defined time period.

|Parameter 1|Final time value of 10ms to 99 000 000ms. If the value is &lt;= 10ms, the program will be aborted.|
|---|---|
|Parameter 2|Pre-set laser power of 0 W to Pmax in watts|

If a longer set time is needed the SET-Command can be combined with the LOOP-Command (see LOOP-Command).

Parameter 1 and parameter 2 can be assigned via the field bus interface. Enter the preferred bus input word with a prefixed "-".

Note - Set command and field bus interface

The power value is calculated once at the execution of the SET command. If the power value is assigned via field bus this value will be used during the complete duration of the command. To change the power value dynamically it is necessary to use the EXT_BUS command.

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 2 RAMP [Time] [Power Output]

The RAMP Command enables a setting of the time for increasing or decreasing the laser output power in the sense of a ramp. It increases/decreases the power from a previously set output power within a selected time, to a different output power.

|Parameter 1|Final time value of 10ms to 99 000 000ms. If the value is &lt;= 10ms, the program will be aborted.|
|---|---|
|Parameter 2|Pre-set output power from 0 W to Pmax in watts|

Parameter 1 and parameter 2 can be assigned via the field bus interface. Enter the preferred bus input word with a prefixed "-".

Version: ll-control 1.8

Page 8-78
---
# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 3 LOOP [Line] [-Number]

The Loop Command serves as an instruction that influences the program run. This command enables repetitive execution of certain routines of the program in a determined number beginning from a certain program line.

# Note

A nesting of the subroutine command is not possible.

|Parameter 1|Determines the program line at which the program is to repeat itself. If the value is 0, the program will be aborted.|
|---|---|
|Parameter 2|The number of times the routine is to be repeated. If the value is 0, the program will be aborted.|

Parameter 1 and parameter 2 can be assigned via the field bus interface. Enter the preferred bus input word with a prefixed "-".

Laserline GmbH, Germany

Version: ll-control 1.8

Page 8-79
---
# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 4 EXT [Time] [--]

The EXT Command enables – in contrast to the Set Command - setting the laser output power via the external hardware interface port X3. For this, the analogue signal is evaluated and limited to a pre-set time via the interface (cf. EXT Operation).

|Parameter 1|Final time value of 10ms to 99 000 000ms. If the value is &lt;= 10ms, the program will be aborted.|
|---|---|
|Parameter 2|Not used.|

Parameter 1 can be assigned via the field bus interface. Enter the preferred bus input word with a prefixed "-".

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 5 SH_OPEN [--] [Power Output]

The SH_Open Command opens the laser beam shutter. The first parameter is not used. The second parameter enables the setting of the output power on opening the beam shutter. When the value is set to 0 W the laser is in the threshold operation. If the pre-set value is greater than 0 W, the laser output power will be ramped up to the pre-set power during the opening phase of the shutter. This is necessary when using the process shutter (cf. ‘System Option / Shutter’).

A pre-defined time is necessary from the time of the command until the shutter is completely opened. This time valve depends on the model type of shutter. Further information can be found in the section on “System Options / Shutter“.

This command is necessary as, in contrast to CW operation, the beam shutter in the programming mode does not automatically open when switching on the laser.

# Note

If the laser system is not equipped with a shutter, this command is skipped over.

|Parameter 1|Not used.|
|---|---|
|Parameter 2|Pre-set power from 0 W to Pmax in watts|

Parameter 2 can be assigned via the field bus interface. Enter the preferred bus input word with a prefixed "-".

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 6 SH_CLOSE [--] [Output Power]

The SV_Close Command closes the beam shutter. The first parameter is not used. The second parameter enables the setting of the output power when closing the laser beam shutter. If the beam power is 0 W, the laser is in threshold operation. If the set value is greater than 0 W, the laser power during the movement phase of the shutter closing will be adjusted to the pre-set value. This is necessary when using the process shutter (cf. “System Options/Shutter“.) A defined time is necessary from the time point of the command until the shutter is completely closed. This time value depends on the model type of the beam shutter used. Further information can be found in the section, “System Options / Shutter“.

# Note

If the laser system is not equipped with a shutter, this command is skipped over.

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|1|Not used.|
|2|Pre-set power from 0 W to Pmax in watts|

# 9 SYSTEM OPTIONS

Info – Using this Manual

In sections 2 to 8, this manual describes the structure, connection and operation of a standard Laserline Diode Laser System.

Those components which are not part of the standard system, such as a beam shutter or particular optics, are described in detail in Section 9. Should any of these components require additional connection work and/or descriptions (beam shutter, field-bus, etc.) such information can also be found in Section 9.

Sections 9 to 14 are individually compiled to describe the respective laser systems and their options.

# 9.1 Laser optics

The laser optics serves to collimate and focus the laser beam. To accomplish this, different lenses are mounted in tubes of differing length one behind the other, depending on the application. Generally, the collimating lenses are situated at the entry side of the laser beam. Optionally, output coupler elements for additional components such as cameras and/or sensors can then be added. The focusing optics are located on the exit side of the beam and are hidden behind protective glass. It is recommended that the protective glass be cleaned at regular intervals, or replaced, as necessary. The connection of the optics takes place either at the laser directly (LDL Series) or by means of a laser light cable (LDF Series). Depending on the requirements of the application (particularly in the case of non-rotational symmetrical laser port geometries) it is also possible to use other variants.

# 9.2 Field-bus interface

By using the Field-bus interface, the laser system can be, for example, integrated, via a profi-bus or inter-bus S interface, into a process network. The vast part of the necessary functions is controllable via the respective field-bus and thus enables a flexible integration of the laser system into any manufacturing process.

The laser operation via the field-bus is always effected in combination with the program modus of the laser system. To facilitate this, one or even several programs can be created or edited in the program editor of the laser system, which are then selected and executed using the field-bus interface.

In addition, the system can (after the respective programming) respond to extreme incidents via the field-bus and, if necessary, transmit feedback messages to the super-ordinated control system.

The displaying and printout of status information, responses to errors within a process application as well as possibilities for limiting user inputs at the display panel of the control unit of the laser system are all functions within the scope of the interface.

On delivery, the field-bus interface is active. Should the field-bus interface not be needed at a later date, it can be deactivated at the control unit; then the system operates as a system without a field-bus (see chapter).

Signal state: If the signal edge changes from an inactive to an active signal, the current program is started. A running program can be aborted using the “Program abort” signal (input word 0 bit 9) – if the program has not already been ended.

Condition: The laser system must have the status “Laser ready” (output word 0 bit 13). The laser system must have been requested by the starting cell (input word 0 bit 0).

Action:

- The current program is started.
- The laser system resets the “Laser ready” signal (output word 0 bit 13). The laser system sets the “Program active” signal (output word 0 bit 12) for as long as the program is being processed.
- If the “Program aborted” signal (output word 0 bit 10) is active, the signal is reset.
- If the program has been processed, the “Laser ready” signal (output word 0 bit 13) is set. The “Program ended” signal (output word 0 bit 11) is set for two seconds.
- In case of a "Program abort” (input word 0 bit 9), the “Program ended” signal (output word 0 bit 11) is not set. Instead, the “Program aborted” signal (output word 0 bit 10) is permanently set until the program is started again.

# 9.3 Beam switch

Setting the beam switch unit into operation is described in chapter "Commissioning and initial start-up / beam switch structure". The additional functions of the software are described below.

# 9.3.1 Selecting Beam Source (CW, SP and EXT Mode)

So that the operation modes CW, SP and EXT can be selected, the "Control / Operation" menu contains a list with the existing out-going beam paths. Here, one can select the respective out-going beam path.

Fig. 99: Beam path selection (1)

Laserline GmbH, Germany Version: 01_01_00 Page 9-79
---
# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 9.3.2 Selecting beam path (PRG Mode)

By using the program mode, the beam path, together with the respective program, is stored. Depending on the selection (e.g. via a field-bus interface), the selected program is loaded and the selected beam path, switched (in the case of the corresponding programming).

# 9.3.3 General

The shutter consists of a mechanical plate (mirror), which can be driven into the beam path, by an electrical drive (stepping motor). In this case the laser power is directed into the beam output and can exit e.g. by a laser light cable. If the plate is moved out of the beam path the laser power is directed into an absorber. No laser power can exit.

# 9.3.4 Using the Shutter

The shutter system can be used for the following functions:

- As a safety protection device
- For extending the lifetime of the laser diodes
- As a process shutter
- As beam switch (in combination with several units)

In general, the beam shutter is used as a protection and safety device and for extending the lifetime of the laser diodes. For the duration the laser is in the ‘Standby’ mode, the laser is pulsed with a so-called ‘diode threshold current’. In conjunction with the threshold operation the undesired change in current is minimized (cf. Section ‘Extending the Lifetime of the Laser Diodes’). The laser shutter can only be used as a process shutter by entering the corresponding programming routine in the program mode.

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 9.3.5 Operation of the laser system equipped with a shutter

When switching the laser system on or off in the CW, SP and EXT modes, the shutter is automatically opened and closed respectively (by using a beam switch a beam path must be selected in advance). In contrast, when operating in the program mode, the shutter is not automatically activated. In order to control the shutter, a special command routine has to be written into the software. Exception: in the case of a premature shut down of the program and exiting the program, the shutter is closed automatically. Info: The Section “Program Mode” contains example programs to set up the control of the shutter.

# 9.3.6 Laser currents dependent on operational mode

Diode laser systems that are equipped with a shutter can operate in four different operational modes: Depending on the respective mode, there are changes in the control as well as the currents with which the laser diodes are pulsed. The beam aperture of the shutter can be in three different statuses during the operation of the laser:

- closed
- open
- in movement

For all three possible shutter statuses, there are specific laser currents.

Laserline GmbH, Germany Version: 01_01_00 Page 9-82
---
# Manual LDF 5000-40

# Fig. 101: Laser currents dependent on movement phase

# Status in CW, SP and EXT operation:

When the shutter is closed, a pre-set current is supplied to the laser diodes (Threshold current). During the movement phase, the current flow through the diodes is re-set to the threshold current of the laser. After that when the shutter is being opened, the current is switched over to the current corresponding to the pre-set beam power of the laser.

# Status in PROG mode:

In program mode, additional the current during shutter movement can be set.

# Info - PROG Mode

# 9.3.7 Safety concept and structure

The laser system is equipped with a dual circuit safety system. In accordance with Safety Category III Norm DIN EN 954-1, the safety system shuts down the laser system. To be able to switch the laser on, both circuits of the safety system must be closed.

A laser system can be equipped with several shutter systems. In such a case, the shutters are networked with each other in a sequence to one shutter system. If the system is equipped with a shutter, the safety circuit then includes the safety contacts of the shutter system. The assignment of the shutter system is then parallel to, and in conjunction with the protection door contact circuits.

# Info - safety circuit

More information concerning the circuits can be found in the electrical drawings in the technical appendix (Safety circuits / principle drawings).

# In principle:

- CW, SP and EXT-Mode: If the safety door is open the laser can not be turned on. If the safety door is opened during laser operating (shutter open) the laser is shut down immediately.
- PRG-Mode: If the safety door is open the laser can not be turned on. If the safety door is opened during laser operating (shutter open) the laser is shut down immediately: If the shutter is closed and the laser is active, the safety door can be opened, the laser is not turned off. If the shutter is closed the laser power will be directed into an absorber.

Laserline GmbH, Germany

Version: 01_01_00

Page 9-84

# Manual LDF 5000-40

It is possible to set the laser into "READY" state in all operating modes (by opened safety doors). In this case the laser is operated with threshold current. The generated minor laser power is directed into the absorber.

To increase process safety, the movement time of the shutter system is monitored by the laser system’s controller. Should the shutter not open or close within a pre-set time, the laser system is automatically shut down. After the operator has acknowledged the error message, the laser can then be re-activated.

# 9.3.8 Extending the lifetime of the laser diodes

The safety concept with a shutter ensures that the laser diodes, even during the time that the protection door is open, are supplied with a flow of current. In this case, the laser need not be shut down when a protection door is opened (e.g. changing of a work piece). The laser remains in continuous operation which significantly extends its lifetime.

# Safety process without shutter system

|Example|In the case of assembly line work and a continuous change of work pieces, the safety sluice of the laser processing room is opened. To prevent endangerment during changing of work pieces, the laser must be ramped down each time from its operational power to the ‘zero power’ position.|
|---|---|
|Result|Switching the laser ON and OFF exposes the laser diodes to a thermal-related contraction and expansion. This has a negative influence on the lifetime of the laser diodes.|

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# Safety process with shutter system

Example: In the case of assembly line work and a continuous change of work pieces, the safety sluice of the laser processing room is opened. To prevent endangerment during changing of work pieces, the beam power is shielded. The laser diodes can continue to be supplied with threshold current.

Result: Using the shutter reduces the load peaks supplied to the laser diodes and, in turn, avoids the thermal contraction and expansion of the laser diodes. This significantly extends the lifetime of the laser diodes.

# 9.3.9 Process Shutter

To significantly relieve the strain of the laser diodes resulting from the thermal expansion and contraction when switching the system on and off, the shutter can be used to modulate the laser output power. In using the process shutter, the laser diodes are kept under constant current. By opening and shutting the shutter within a limited time period, a ‘pulsing’ of the laser output power can be realized and concentrated on the work piece. The application of a shutter used as a process shutter can only be carried out in the PROG operational mode. Further information and examples for such operation can be found in the Section “Operation in/PROG-Mode“.

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# Note - Overload

- In order to protect the shutter from overload during its operation, a maximum time cycle is limited to f= 1.75 Hz (short time max cycle: f= 2.80Hz).
- Should the time cycle be exceeded, the shutter responds after the 5th ‘closing’ with a mandatory pause of approximately 5 seconds.

# 9.3.10 Description of function:

# 9.3.10.1 Initialization

After switching on the supply unit, the shutter begins its initialization phase (travel). During this initialization phase (travel), the end positions ‘OPEN’ and ‘Closed’ are travelled in sequence. This automatically checks the system as to whether it is operating flawlessly. The time necessary for the initialization phase is less than 5 seconds.

# 9.3.10.2 Operation Mode

After having successfully completed the initialization, the system is now ready to receive control commands. The response time of the shutter depends on the model of shutter being used. The shutter always requires the same time (no jitter) beginning with the movement command until it reaches its end position.

In the case of supply units VG 2-5, the connection of the data line between the telephone system and the module is within the connection compartment of the supply unit.

Fig. 104: Connection jack for modem line / RJ 11 plug

For a connection to the telephone jack, the supplied TAE line can be used. Should there be no TAE connection jack available, an alternative would be using a connecting cable with RJ11 / RJ45 plugs.

Info – Test modem
In the case of an analogue modem, the connection via dialling the modem number with a telephone can be checked. When the signals of the modem can be heard in the telephone receiver, the connection has been correctly carried out.

# TROUBLESHOOTING

The laser control unit continually monitors the functions of the laser system. In case of functional errors or the exceeding of limit values, warning and/or error messages are issued. These are displayed on the client interface (as collective errors), on the console (in text form) and coded via an optional field bus interface. Messages can be viewed in the display:

- Select main menu “Diagnosis” and switch to the sub menu “Errors”.

Warning and error messages related to optional components are marked with an * next to the message number.

# 10.1 Warning Messages

A warning message indicates that a value is not within the normal working range. In such a case, the limit value has not yet been reached. A “warning message” does not lead to a shutdown of the laser system: normal work can be continued. Nevertheless, measures should be taken to eliminate the causes of the warning message in order to obviate the issuing of an error message.

# 10.2 Error Messages

The issuing of an error message means that a limit value has been exceeded or a malfunction has been detected. When a fault message is issued, then the laser system will shut down. The error must be corrected before normal operation can proceed.

Note – Drying capsules

One drying capsule is required for each stack. When servicing the unit, it is best to replace all capsules at the same time.

Important: Drying capsules cannot be stored indefinitely! Please observe the expiry date printed on the capsules and do not use after this date.

# 11.4 Laser optic maintenance

# 11.4.1 Cleaning the protective glass on the optics

The optics of the diode laser are protected from contamination by a protective glass. This protective glass is coated. However, steam and gases produced during processing can cause the protective glass to become soiled.

The cleaning of optical elements always poses a threat to the quality of the surface, particularly with regard to the protective coating applied. For this reason, the condition of the protective glass must be checked regularly.

Cleaning should, if possible, be effected in several stages. Gloves should be worn to protect the hands from solvents and to avoid leaving fingerprints. If fingerprints are left on the optical surface, they must be removed immediately, as the acidity of the skin can aggravate the surface and coating.

- To begin cleaning, free the area of dust using either dry air or nitrogen.
- In the second stage, remove any stubborn particles with a lint-free cloth which has been previously dipped in isopropyl or ethanol.

# 11.5.3 Replacing the DI cartridge

The DI cartridge in the cooling system ensures that the level of conductance of the coolant is always in the range of ca. 1 - 3 μS/cm.

Note

The replacing of the DI cartridge is not based on the expiry of a specific period of time. The cartridge should only be replaced if the value rises above 3μS/cm. The unit will issue a warning message via the operating device when the level reaches 3μS/cm.

The replacing of the DI cartridge is not based on the expiry of a specific period of time. The cartridge should only be replaced if the value rises over the threshold. The unit will issue a warning message via the operating device in this case. It is therefore advisable to always have at least one spare cartridge on hand.

The current level of conductance can be read from the operating device (cf. Chapter “Operation“). The DI cartridge is replaced as follows:

- The DI cartridge is attached on the left next to the water filter and is held in place from above and below with clips.
- To replace the cartridge, firstly push it up, then remove it out front ways.

# 11.7 Replacing the drying capsules

Humidity in the housing of a diode stack must be kept at a low value. A drying capsule in the stack housing absorbs any moisture and stores it. Depending on ambient conditions, the capsule reaches maximum absorption after some time and has to be replaced. Observe the specified replacement intervals.

The laser control system monitors humidity in the diode stack. If the humidity value exceeds the limit value, this is indicated by a warning message.

If you fail to replace the drying capsule in the event of a warning message, moisture may reach the error limit. In this case, it will no longer be possible to operate the diode laser. The laser will only be operational again once the drying capsule has been replaced and the error limit is undershot. The drying capsule should be replaced in particular following a prolonged idle period.

# Information – drying time

The drying process can last between 5 and 24 hours at high humidity values.

# Note – replace drying capsules

- A clean environment is essential for changing drying capsules. Neither dust nor other particles may get into the opening for the drying agent! Open the transport bag for the drying agent only immediately before replacement. Even a few minutes in ambient air result in a reduction in drying properties.
- Ensure that the paper lid of the drying capsule is facing inwards (towards the stack).

# 12.2 Safety circuits of the beam source

The laser equipment features two independent safety circuits.

- Safety circuit: double electrical circuit used for monitoring of laser covers, laser light cable, shutter and safety doors. The laser beam is switched off in case of interruption (open circuit) of the safety circuit.
- EML circuit: the power circuits and the coolant pump are switched off in case of interruption (open circuit) of the EML circuit.

# 12.2.1 Safety circuit (SCT)

The safety circuit is a category 3 safety circuit (DIN/EN 954-1).

The safety circuit is a zero signal current based circuit. When a safety switch opens, the safety circuit is interrupted. According to the operation status:

- The laser beam is switched off, the shutter closed and an error message is generated.
- The laser beam cannot be activated (the laser beam is guided into the beam dump).
- An error message is generated when only one of the two circuits closes (synchronization).
- An error message is generated when one of the two circuits closes with a delay (synchronization).

Operation of the laser can only be resumed after acknowledgment of the error message. A self-check of the safety switch-off is performed after reactivation of the mains supply. The safety circuits will only be validated after successful check.

# 12.2.1.1 Key switch

The key switch of the supply unit prevents from unauthorized start-up of the laser equipment.

- It is impossible to operate the laser when key switch is on "0". This position allows withdrawal of the key.
- Only the alignment laser can be activated when key switch on "1". This position allows withdrawal of the key.
- In position "2" both the LED mode and the laser can be operated with power. If the safety doors or the safety circuit are open, only the alignment laser can be activated. This position does not allow withdrawal of the key.

# 12.2.1.2 Safety door interface

The safety components of the processing station are connected to the safety door interface (e.g. the safety contacts). The safety door interface with the connected safety components form the safety door circuit.

The safety components implemented in the safety door circuit must comply with the DIN EN 954-1 standard, safety category III. Location of the safety door interface according to the supply unit version:

- Above the beam outlet (units with more than one beam outlet/beam switch).
- Under the X3A interface (units with single beam outlet).

# 12.2.4 E-Stop circuit (ECT)

It is only possible to operate the laser system with a double loop emergency stop circuit. An interruption of the ECT-circuit immediately switches off the coolant pump and the power circuits. The laser system generates an error message on the control panel. The E-Stop circuit must remain open (interrupted) during 30 seconds. It can be closed after this delay and the error message can be acknowledged. If this delay is not met, an error of the coolant pump frequency converter occurs.

# Information – E-Stop circuit

The synchronization of both circuits is monitored. No validation occurs when one of the circuits has a delay. Both circuits must be opened and closed again at the same time.

A wrong connection of the emergency stop circuit may lead to ineffective EMO buttons. In this case the laser system will not deactivate when pressing an EMO button and create a situation which could provoke death or serious injury.

# DANGER

- The connection of the emergency stop circuit can only be carried out by a specialized electrician.
- All components of the E-Stop circuit have to be carefully controlled prior to the first-time start-up.
- The emergency stop function must be checked periodically.

# 12.3.1 Digital Inputs

# Error reset

With ERROR RESET a X3B:19 (Error reset) must be connected with +24 V via button function. The signal status is evaluated. A change from LOW to HIGH results in the set back of a probable pending failure message of the laser system. Depending on the kind of error this is only possible once, and the pending failure must have been removed first.

# Laser ready

With LASER READY the diode laser system is put to the status READY. (Rapid Input)

X3B:20 (Laser ready) must be connected with +24 V via button function. The signal edge is evaluated. A change from LOW to HIGH results in the status READY of the diode laser system. A change from HIGH to LOW takes back the status READY of the diode laser system. If, for example, the status READY was taken back by a failure, the system can only be transferred back to READY, if a rising slope has been recognized. If the system is READY, the Laser ready signal has been set (see also DIGITAL OUTPUTS).

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# Program start / stop

The PROGRAM START X3B:21 (Program Start/Stop) must be connected via a button (switch) function with +24 V. Program start reacts on a rising edge signal. Program stop reacts on the signal status.

(Rapid input) A change from LOW to HIGH results in program start. If the signal state changes to LOW the program is stopped. Minimum delay time between two (or more) program start sequences is 350 ms. Otherwise errors in the laser's reaction are possible. Do not use mechanical contacts.

PROGRAM START / STOP refer to the starting and stopping of a laser program in the PRG mode (see chapter PRG-Mode). The operation modes CW, SP and EXT concerns programs, however, that are firmly programmed into the laser control. Therefore, these modes are also started or stopped using PROGRAM START / STOP.

If the system is equipped with a shutter (optional), it is opened at a setting of +24 V and closed at 0 V (only in CW, SP and EXT-modes). As soon as a program is active and therefore laser power can be released, the “Program active signal“ is set, (see digital outputs).

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# Pilot laser On / Off

PILOT LASER ON/OFF X3B:22 (Pilot laser On/Off) must be connected via a button (switch) function with +24 V. The signal status is evaluated.

- +24 V => Pilot ON
- Open contact => Pilot OFF

If the pilot of alignment laser is switched on, the “Pilot active signal” is set (see digital outputs).

# WAIT 1 + WAIT 2 (Program Mode)

The WAIT inputs are X3B 23, 24 (WAIT) fulfills the condition TRUE (1), if there is a 24 V level. If there is a 0 V level, the condition FALSE (2) is fulfilled.

With a WAIT input an operation can be triggered, provoking a certain reaction from the program mode. For further information please read chapter “Prog. Operation“.

Please Note

The maximum current capacity of these outputs is 500 mA!

# Group failure

With the GROUP X3B:1 (Group failure) must be connected FAILURE a failure of the laser system is announced. If a diode laser failure occurs, the signalling unit is activated. For integration in a process the signal can also be called up via a PLC / control PC.

# Laser ready signal

With LASER READY SIGNAL the diode laser READY mode is being monitored.

X3B:2 (Laser ready signal) can be connected via a signalling unit (control lamp) to a grounding unit. If the diode laser is in READY mode, the signalling unit is activated. For integration in a process the signal can also be called up via a PLC / control PC.

# Laser active signal

LASER ACTIVE SIGNAL X3B:3 (Laser active signal) can be connected via a signalling unit (control lamp) to a grounding unit.

The signalling unit is activated when:

- Pilot / Alignment Laser is on
- Stack test is in progress
- Laser is on

For integration in a process the signal can also be called up via a PLC / control PC.

# Pilot active signal

PILOT ACTIVE SIGNAL X3B:4 (Pilot active signal) can be connected via a signalling unit (control lamp) with grounding.

After switching on the alignment or LED mode, the signalling unit is activated.

For integration in a process the signal can also be called up via a PLC / control PC.

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# Program active signal

PROGRAM_ACTIVE_SIGNAL is set as soon as a laser program has been run. It can be connected via a signalling unit (control lamp) to a grounding device. The signalling unit is activated as soon as a laser program is active, and laser power can be emitted. The signalling unit is not illuminated if the Pilot-/Alignment laser are on or a stack test is active. The PROGRAM_ACTIVE_SIGNAL refers to a laser program in PRG-Mode (see chapter PRG-Mode). In the case of operation modes CW, SP and EXT, it also concerns programs that are, however, firmly programmed in the laser control unit. Therefore, these modes also set the signal as soon as the laser power can be emitted.

# SET A1 + SET A2 (Program Mode)

The SET outputs are X3B.5, 6 (SET A1 and A2) become TRUE (24 V), if they are set as message display by the program mode for example. If they are set back, the level changes to 0 V (LOW). With a SET output an external operation can be triggered, which can be set equivalently by the program mode. For further information please read chapter “Prog. Operation“.

# 12.3.4 Analogue Outputs

Current circuit 1 / Power circuit 2

Using „CURRENT CIRCUIT 1 and CURRENT CIRCUIT 2“, the diode laser current of circuit 1 and 2 (if equipped) can be monitored.

An output voltage of 0 – 10 V corresponds to a diode current of 0 – 110A.

For integration in a process the signal can also be called up via a PLC / control PC.

The laser power can be taken from the current/power diagram which is delivered with the laser.

# Coolant temperature (optional)

With COOLANT TEMPERATURE, the current coolant temperature can be indicated.

X3B:31 can be against X3B:32 (GND) via a monitoring unit (e.g. Voltmeter) connected together.

An output voltage of 0 – 10 V corresponds to a temperature of 33°C to 15°C.

For integration in a process the signal can also be called up via a PLC / control PC.

# TELESERVICE

There are two ways to access the teleservice:

- ISDN adapter / analogue modem in the beam source, with direct connection to Laserline through the phone network.
- Network interface in the beam source via the Internet through a VPN connection to the Laserline VPN server.

# 13.1 Direct connection through the phone network

For the teleservice purposes, the Laserline Service establishes a direct connection within the beam source (ISDN adapter or modem) via modem or ISDN adapter. The beam source must be connected to an analogue or ISDN line and the Laserline Service must know the related phone number. Usually, a direct connection can be implemented easily (telephone line) and will meet all the teleservice requirements. Only the option “Service camera” will request a larger bandwidth (only available with teleservice via the Internet).

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 13.2 Internet connection via VPN

The beam sources (from version 1.8 of the LL-Control Software) have the necessary software to build up a VPN connection with the VPN server of Laserline. Contrary to a teleservice via a direct connection, this method builds up a connection to the VPN server of Laserline through the beam source (customer). The advantage of this method is that the customer’s firewall does not need to accept an incoming call for the purpose of the teleservice. Only an outgoing connection via port 1193:UDP has to be authorized in the firewall.

The software builds up a VPN connection to the VPN server of Laserline via the Internet access (e.g. DSL). The encrypted teleservice communication is established with Laserline through the so-called VPN tunnel. A VPN connection via modem is not supported.

# Manual LDF 5000-40

# 13.2.1 Proxy

Additionally, access to the Internet is supported by a web proxy. The access data of the web proxy are entered in the console of the beam source. The settings of the customer’s web proxy must authorize the access to vpn.laserline.de.

# 13.3 Glossary

# 13.3.1 VPN

Short for Virtual Private Network, a network that is constructed by using public lines to connect computers (partners). Most VPN implementations use the Internet as the public infrastructure for transporting data and a variety of specialized protocols to support private communications through the Internet utilizing a technique called tunnelling. These systems use encryption and other security mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the network and that the data cannot be intercepted.

Laserline GmbH, Germany Version: 01_01_02 Page 13-3

# 13.3.2 Firewall

A system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software, or a combination of both. Firewalls are frequently used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing private networks connected to the Internet, especially intranets. All messages entering or leaving the intranet pass through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria.

# 13.3.3 Router

A network device that forwards packets from one network to another. Based on internal routing tables, routers read each incoming packet and decide how to forward it. The destination address in the packets determines which line (interface) outgoing packets are directed to.

# 13.3.4 Proxy

In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application program) that acts as a go-between for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource, available from a different server. The proxy server evaluates the request according to its filtering rules.
