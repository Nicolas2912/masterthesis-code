Tab. 2 Ambient conditions for transport and storage on page EN-4

# 5 Functional description

The MasterLiner consists of individual segments that can each be rotated by 360°. Each segment contains four rollers that make it possible to almost seamlessly feed the wire from the available wire container (drum/spool) to the wire feeder. When using two wire feeders, the MasterLiner is installed in the middle.

# 5.1 System overview

NOTICE

- Note the bending radius directly after the wire feeder. We recommend mechanically securing the MasterLiner in such a manner that the robot’s movement does not transfer any bending and tensile forces that occur to the MasterLiner.
- When using the MasterLiner Basic, note the wire feed direction.

# MasterLiner Maxi Flex/HD; Basic Flex/HD

# DANGER

Risk of injury due to unexpected start-up. The following instructions must be followed during all maintenance, servicing, assembly, disassembly, and repair work:

- Switch off the power source.
- Disconnect all electrical connections.

# WARNING

Electric shock. Dangerous voltage due to defective cables.

- Check all live cables and connections for proper installation and damage.
- Replace any damaged, deformed or worn parts.

# NOTICE

- Please take note of the following instructions: 3 Product description on page EN-4
- The system may only be installed and commissioned by qualified personnel (in Germany, see TRBS 1203).
- Components must only be used in environments with sufficient ventilation.
- The interconnection (serial or parallel connection) of several power sources may result in material damage.

# 6.1 Attaching the MasterLiner

# NOTICE

- Ensure the MasterLiner is the correct length.
- Avoid bending the MasterLiner unnecessarily when it is laid. Laying in a cable carrier is essentially possible. However, breaches of the minimum bending radii can cause damage and wire feed irregularities. Note the bending radii for use when dynamically laying the MasterLiner: 3.2 Suspension/total bending angle of all bending radii on page EN-7
- When suspending MasterLiner of any type, use suitable mounts, strain relief devices for the wire feeder and wire drums as well as the total wire feed distance.

The section below presents and describes the installation using a QC quick connector.

# 6 Commissioning

# 6.1.1 Wire drum connection – feeding in the wire through an internal wire guide

NOTICE
- Note the minimum passage size and the permissible wire dimensions for the various MasterLiner types.

We recommend attaching a wire guide of a suitable length to the wire drum cover. Advantage: any dirt on the wire is removed in the wire inlet, meaning that less dirt gets into the wire guide. The internal wire guide can be detached if necessary and cleaned.

# Other advantages

Avoidance of wire knots
Avoidance of wire knots
Avoidance of contact and the wire looping round the wire drum’s components

Fig. 5 Advantages

NOTICE
- If the wire ends are not close fitting, the small passage size of the MasterLiner Basic may prevent the wire from being fed in.

Fig. 6 Wire feed

1. Push the wire end through the internal wire guide.
2. Bend the wire end over by approx. 10 mm.

# 6.1.2 Connecting the MasterLiner to a wire drum

NOTICE
- We recommend connecting the wire guide to the wire drum cover using a QC quick coupling.
- Ensure that the quick coupling is correctly and securely attached to the wire drum.

Fig. 7 Wire drum connection

1. Push the connection sleeve (quick coupling) (3) with the wire guide onto the connection (1). Twisting the connection sleeve (3) prevents the connection from accidentally coming loose.

Compatible threaded connections are available for all MasterLiner versions without a QC quick coupling. The order data and ID numbers can be found in the current product catalogues.

Contact details for support and placing orders can be found online at www.binzel-abicor.com.

# 6.1.3 Wire feed side

Feed in the welding wire until reaching the wire feeder. Next, cut off the bent section of wire. Push the wire into the wire feeder’s wire inlet.

Connect the MasterLiner’s quick connector to the wire feeder and feed in the wire.

Twist the connection sleeve clockwise to prevent the quick connector from accidentally coming loose.

Fig. 11 Laying in the cable carrier

# NOTICE

- When laying the MasterLiner in a cable carrier, note and observe the permissible bending radii.
- Avoid bending the MasterLiner unnecessarily when it is laid. Laying in a cable carrier is essentially possible. Breaches of the minimum bending radii can cause damage and wire feed irregularities. Note the bending radii for use when dynamically laying the MasterLiner: 3.2 Suspension/total bending angle of all bending radii on page EN-7.
- All MasterLiner types are essentially suitable for dynamic movements. For very high dynamic forces and rapid robot movements, use the MasterLiner HD version.
- For applications involving a longer wire feed distance and/or multiple bends, we strongly recommend using an additional wire drive near the wire drum.
- When suspending MasterLiner of any type, use suitable mounts, strain relief devices for the wire feeder and wire drums as well as the wire feed distance.
- The MasterLiner HD and MasterLiner Flex can, in principle, be used in combination. To do so, use suitable connectors.

# 7 Operation

# NOTICE

- The system may only be operated by qualified personnel (in Germany see TRBS 1203).
- Before connecting the cable assembly to the wire feeder, check whether the proper wire guide (liner or PA liner) in accordance with the wire diameter and wire type has been inserted.

# 8 Putting out of operation

# NOTICE

- As the MasterLiner is integrated into a welding system, the process for putting it out of operation depends on the control system. Please make sure that the shutdown procedures for all components integrated in the welding system are strictly observed.

# 9 Maintenance and cleaning

Under normal operating conditions, the MasterLiner does not require maintenance. Scheduled maintenance and cleaning are prerequisites for a long service life and trouble-free operation.

# DANGER

Risk of injury due to unexpected start-up

The following instructions must be followed during all maintenance, servicing, assembly, disassembly, and repair work:

- Switch off the power source.
- Disconnect all electrical connections.

# DANGER

Electric shock

Dangerous voltage due to defective cables.

- Check all live cables and connections for proper installation and damage.
- Replace any damaged, deformed or worn parts.

# NOTICE

- Maintenance and cleaning work may be carried out only by qualified personnel (in Germany see TRBS 1203).
- Always wear your personal protective equipment when performing maintenance and cleaning work.
- Please also consult the operating instructions for all welding components, e.g. the coolant recirculator, wire feeder and welding torch.

# 9.1 Maintenance intervals

# NOTICE

The specified maintenance intervals are standard values and refer to single-shift operation. The additional operating conditions can shorten the maintenance intervals.

When using arc welding equipment, always observe the provisions of EN 60974-4 Inspection and testing, as well as any national laws and regulations.

We recommend conducting the following checks when replacing an empty wire drum with a full one. Check the following:

# Weekly
