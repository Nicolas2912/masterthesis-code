# 5 Functional description

The media required for the welding process (welding current, shielding gas, coolant and blast air) are passed through the MF1 master feeder and fed to the torch. The interfaces with the torch and the cable assembly are adapted to the application-specific requirements. The MF1 master feeder is fastened to the robot or the safety cut-out by means of a robot mount. The four-roll drive feeds the wire at a constant wire feed. The master feeder takes over the "Push" function here. The wire can be fed directly by means of a MasterLiner or by means of a second slave drive that is tuned exactly to the master feeder. This slave drive is integrated, for example, into the M-Drive, MF1-Rear or a power source.
