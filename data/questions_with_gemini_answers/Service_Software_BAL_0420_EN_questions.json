      "answer": "To manually reinstall the driver after a failed automatic detection, follow these steps:\n\n## Manual Driver Reinstallation\n\n1.  **Access the Device Manager:** Open the Device Manager on your PC. This can typically be done by searching for \"Device Manager\" in the Windows search bar.\n2.  **Identify the Unknown Device:** Look for the \"FT232R USB UART\" under \"Other Devices\" with a yellow exclamation mark, indicating a driver issue.\n3.  **Update Driver Software:** Right-click on the unknown device and select \"Update Driver Software.\"\n4.  **Browse My Computer:** Choose the option to \"Browse my computer for driver software.\"\n5.  **Specify Driver Location:** Manually enter the path to the driver file. The driver file is located in the installation directory that was either adopted from the default settings or defined manually during the software installation. For example, the path might be `C:\\ProgramData\\MFS_SERVICE_SOFTWARE_DATA` or a custom location you specified.\n6.  **Install the Driver:** Click \"Next\" to install the driver. Windows will guide you through the installation process.\n7.  **Verify Installation:** After installation, check the Device Manager again. The \"FT232R USB UART\" should now appear under \"Ports (COM & LPT)\" without any errors, indicating successful driver installation.",

      "answer": "To properly manage log files within the MFS service software, you must configure the log file path, data format, and ring buffer settings.\n\n## Log File Path Configuration\n\n1.  **Select a Folder Path**: Choose a directory in Windows where log files will be saved. Click ‘Select this path for log files’ to confirm.\n2.  **Ethernet Communication**: If Ethernet communication is active, the system automatically creates a subfolder within the defined path, named with the corresponding IP address. This helps organize logs from different devices.\n\n## Data Format\n\n*   Specify the separator to be used in the created CSV file. This ensures data is properly formatted for analysis.\n\n## Ring Buffer\n\n*   **Enable the Ring Buffer**: Activate the ring buffer to automatically delete log data older than a specified number of days. This prevents the accumulation of excessive log data and manages disk space effectively.\n*   **Apply Settings**: After configuring these settings, click ‘Apply’ to save them.",

The eBOX must be switched off and disconnected from the mains. Connect the RS interface converter to the SERVICE connection bush on the eBOX and to the PC via a USB port. Then, connect the eBOX to the mains power supply and switch it on.\n2.  **Ethernet (eBOX MFS-V3 and eBOX MFS-V2 with Profinet only):** Requires an Ethernet patch cable. Switch on the eBOX and establish a connection between the eBOX and PC using the cable. Then, connect to the mains.\n3.  **CAN (eBOX MFS-V3 with hand terminal MF control only):** Connect the MF control to the eBOX (X10 hand terminal) and switch on the eBOX. The MF control comes with Windows 7 Embedded and boots as soon as the eBOX is switched on.",
