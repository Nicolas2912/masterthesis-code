      "question": "What is the procedure to follow if the robot system must be accessed inside the safety fence for maintenance or programming adjustments, and what specific precautions should be taken regarding the enabling device (deadman switch) on the teach pendant?",
      "category": "SAFETY",
      "safety_critical": true,
      "answer": "When entering the safety fence, ensure the robot system is completely stopped before entry, and never enter while the robot is moving. Confirm the stop condition indicator lamp shows the robot is stopped, and enter through the safety gate. To inform others of your presence, display a \"working\" sign. During teaching or testing, exercise special care due to unexpected movements, and teach from a position allowing escape from danger. Enable the \"Safe speed\" signal. If multiple workers are present, one should be in charge with the teach pendant, and others must follow their orders, prohibiting external interface or control panel operations without permission. All personnel must secure escape zones to avoid hazards from unintended robot movement, and care should be taken not to block each other's escape routes. Avoid operating the robot while resting against walls or equipment that could obstruct escape. Continuously monitor the robot during jogging or program verification. Immediately stop the robot using the E-stop switch if a dangerous situation is recognized, and ideally, have another person outside the fence monitor and be ready to use the E-stop. Make sure that the enabling device (deadman switch) on the teach pendant is operated only by hand. Finally, ensure no one remains inside the safety fence before closing the gate, and do not leave tools or equipment within the robot's operating space after finishing work. Based on the risk assessment by FANUC, the number of operations of the enabling device (DEADMAN switch) must not exceed about 10000 times per year.\nReference page_30_figure_1.png",

      "category": "SAFETY",
      "safety_critical": true,
      "answer": "The J1-axis of the CRX-10iA robot has a software-defined motion limit, which restricts its rotation to a specific range. Exceeding these limits, also known as overtravel (OT), is detected at both ends of the motion limit for the axis. \n\nThe J1-axis motion limit for the CRX-10iA is ±190º. This means the axis can rotate 190 degrees in both the positive and negative directions from its zero point position. \nReference page_64_figure_1.png\n\nIf the robot attempts to exceed these limits due to programming errors or external forces, the system will detect the overtravel condition and initiate a controlled stop to prevent mechanical damage. The robot cannot exceed the motion range unless there is a loss of zero point position due to abnormalities in the servo system or system error. It is important to note that the motion range can be changed, and further information on how to change the motion range can be found in Chapter 6, “AXIS LIMIT SETUP”.",

      "category": "MULTI_CHAPTER",
      "safety_critical": true,
      "answer": "## Collaborative Robot Contact Stop Function\n\n### Functionality (Section 3.6)\n\n*   When the external force exceeds the external force limit, the robot stops. For example, when a person contacts the robot and a big external force is added to the robot, the robot stops.\n*   This function does not guarantee safety in all situations. Additional appropriate safeguarding measures must be placed as the need arises.\n\n### Limitations (Section 3.6)\n\n*   The external force is calculated by the torque acting on each axis. Therefore, when the robot contacts at the point near the each axis, the robot may not stop even if the external force is more than the external force limit.\n*   On the other hand, when the robot contacts at the point far from the each axis, the robot may stop even if the external force is smaller than the external force limit.\n*   A default value of external force limit is 150N. The external force limit can’t increase more than 150N.\n*   Motion groups other than Collaborative robot are outside of the scope of the contact stop function.\n\n### Collaborative Workspace Design Considerations (Section 3.6)\n\n*   **Escape Space:** The space where a person escapes at contacting to robot must be placed between collaborative workspace and wall, floor, etc. If the space can’t be placed, the robot system must be designed to use additional appropriate safeguarding measures. Example, when a person access to dangerous space, the robot stops.\n*   **Force Reduction:**\n    *   Reduce the robot's motion speed near the place where pinching is occurred.\n    *   Cover the object or the table with a soft material because the lower the rigidity of the contact point, the smaller the generated force.\n*   **Personnel Training:** Untrained people must not enter collaborative workspace.\n*   **Safe Movement:** The ambient working space in which people may collide with the collaborative robot shall be arranged so they can move safely.\n*   **Head and Neck Protection:** The robot system must be designed not to contact robot to head or neck of person with frequency.\n\nThese considerations are crucial for minimizing the risk of injury in collaborative workspaces.",
