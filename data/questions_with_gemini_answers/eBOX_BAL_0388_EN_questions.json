      "answer": "To ensure proper functionality when using an eBOX with an MF1 and MF1 rear drive, the following connections must be established:\n\n## Establishing Connections for eBOX, MF1, and MF1 Rear Drive\n\n1.  **Wire End Sensor Connection:** Connect the wire end sensor to the appropriate input on the eBOX. This allows the system to detect when the wire supply is running low.\n2.  **Control Lead Connection:** Establish a connection between the eBOX and the masterfeeder (MF1/MF1 DIG./sensor) using the designated control lead. This facilitates communication and control signals between the eBOX and the masterfeeder.\n3.  **Drive Connections:** Ensure that both the MF1 front drive and the MF1 rear drive are properly connected to the eBOX. These connections are essential for controlling the wire feeding process.\n\n*   The flex supply provides power to the masterfeeder.\n*   The masterliner guides the wire from the barrel to the welding torch.\n*   The wire end sensor control lead transmits the signal from the sensor to the eBOX.",

When using an internal power supply, configure the following jumper settings on the main PCB: Set jumper to on (bottom position), jumper to on (left position), and jumper to on (bottom position). Then switch on the eBOX at the main switch Q1.\nReference page_10_figure_1.png\nOn an AIDA-compliant eBOX, the logic circuit is externally powered via the X3 port in order to avoid any bus communication failure if the internal power supply fails. When using an external power supply, configure the following jumper settings on the main PCB, always retaining the order shown: \n1. Set jumper to off (top position), jumper to on (left position) and jumper to on (top position).\n2. Switch on the eBOX at the main switch Q1\n3. Connect the AIDA power connector to the X3 port.\nReference page_11_figure_1.png\nThere is the danger of an electric shock because of dangerous voltage due to defective cables. Therefore:\n- Check that all live cables and connections are properly installed.\n- Replace any damaged, deformed or worn parts\n- Insert the mains plug into the mains port X1.\nReference page_15_figure_1.png",
