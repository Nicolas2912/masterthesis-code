      "category": "VISUAL",
      "safety_critical": true,
      "answer": "When installing the MasterLiner in a robotic welding cell, several factors are critical for ensuring optimal wire feeding and system reliability.\n\n## MasterLiner Installation and Wire Feeding Considerations\n\n1.  **Bending Radius and Total Bending Angle**: Pay close attention to the bending radius of the MasterLiner, especially near the wire feeder and wire drum. Breaching the minimum permissible bending radii can cause wire feed irregularities. The maximum total bending angle should not exceed 3x180° + 1x90° (~630°).\n2.  **Suspension and Strain Relief**: Use suitable mounts and strain relief devices for both the wire feeder and wire drum connections. This prevents bending and tensile forces from the robot's movement from being transferred to the MasterLiner, which can cause damage and wire feed problems.\n3.  **Wire Feed Direction**: For MasterLiner Basic versions, ensure the wire feed direction is correctly oriented as indicated on the product label or threaded connections during installation. Incorrect direction can lead to wire jams and feeding problems.\n4.  **Length and Laying**: Ensure the MasterLiner is the correct length for the application and avoid unnecessary bending during installation. When laying the MasterLiner in a cable carrier, adhere to the permissible bending radii to prevent damage and wire feed issues.\n5.  **Additional Drive**: For wire feed distances exceeding 25 meters, or in applications with multiple bends, consider using an additional wire drive near the wire drum to ensure consistent wire feeding.\n\n*   Proper installation and attention to these details will help prevent wire feed irregularities, device damage, and ensure reliable operation of the robotic welding cell.",

      "category": "VISUAL",
      "safety_critical": false,
      "answer": "When installing the MasterLiner Basic, it is crucial to note the wire feed direction indicated on the product label or the threaded connections. Failing to observe this direction can lead to wire jams and feeding problems. Here's why this is important:\n\n## Wire Feed Direction and Potential Issues\n\n*   **Product Label and Threaded Connections:** The MasterLiner Basic has a specific wire feed direction, indicated by an arrow on the nameplate. This ensures the wire is properly aligned as it enters the system.\n*   **Wire Jams:** If the wire is fed against the intended direction, it can easily jam within the MasterLiner. This is because the internal components are designed to guide the wire in one specific direction.\n*   **Feeding Problems:** Even if a complete jam doesn't occur, incorrect wire feed direction can cause inconsistent or erratic wire feeding. This affects the welding process, leading to defects and potential downtime.",
